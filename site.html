    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I design game systems centered around clarity, strategic depth, and player experience.
        My work explores how mechanics shape decision-making and how onboarding impacts engagement.
        I am currently studying Game Studies at the University of Delaware.

        <h3>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe – Paper Prototype</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Project Overview:</strong><br>
            This paper prototype explores Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, a layered two-player strategy game
            built around a grid of smaller grids. The objective is to win three mini-boards in a row
            on a larger meta-board, creating multi-level strategic decision-making.
        </p>

        <img src="tic.png" alt="Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Paper Prototype">

        <p>
            <strong>Design Goal:</strong><br>
            Increase the strategic depth of traditional Tic-Tac-Toe while keeping the rules
            understandable for first-time players. The system needed to function entirely without code.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Core Mechanic:</strong><br>
            Each move determines the opponent’s next board location. This forced board placement
            creates two layers of strategic planning: players must think about winning the current
            mini-board while also controlling their opponent’s next move.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
            • No digital rule enforcement<br>
            • Rules had to be clearly communicated through layout and explanation<br>
            • The board design needed to visually communicate the layered structure<br>
            • The system had to be fully playable as a paper prototype
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Playtesting Insights:</strong><br>
            During testing, players initially needed clarification on the forced placement rule.
            Once understood, they appreciated the added strategic complexity compared to standard Tic-Tac-Toe.
            This reinforced the importance of onboarding and rule communication,
            similar to how video games introduce mechanics through tutorial levels.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Iteration Concept:</strong><br>
            A future iteration would expand the main grid from 9x9 to 18x18, increasing the
            number of possible moves and encouraging deeper long-term planning.
            This would preserve the core mechanic while significantly increasing strategic depth.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
            This project demonstrated that strong mechanics rely on clarity.
            Even well-designed systems can fail if players do not immediately understand
            how their decisions shape future outcomes.
